        <h2>SPRING</h2>
        <img src="flw.webp" width="20%" />
        <p>
          Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate
          seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various
          technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies
          according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in
          the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and
          vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are
          approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and
          nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses. Spring and
          "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth,
          rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and
          tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other
          seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have
          local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms
          originating in Europe.

        <p>
          Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after
          spring and before autumn. At or around the summer solstice (about 3
          days before Midsummer Day), the earliest sunrise and latest sunset
          occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day
          length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The
          date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate,
          tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere,
          it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.

        <h2>WINTER</h2>
        <img src="winter.jpg" width="20%" />
        <p>
          Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones;
          it does not occur in most of the tropical zone. It occurs after autumn
          and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the
          Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different
          cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a
          definition based on weather. When it is winter in the Northern
          Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
          In many regions, winter is associated with snow and freezing
          temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's
          elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most
          negative value (that is, the Sun is at its farthest below the horizon
          as measured from the pole). The day on which this occurs has the
          shortest day and the longest night, with day length increasing and
          night length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.
          The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions
          differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend
          on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year
          caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit
